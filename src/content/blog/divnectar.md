This is the third iteration of my website, DivNectar.

I've chosen to develop the website using AstroJS this time around, for it's near-vanilla JS feel and ability to integrate other front-end frameworks into the framework with ease. I've chosen SvelteJS as my sister-framework on this project, as it provides some form of state control with very little code, and it isn't too far from Astro's syntax as well so it fits nicely.
